# Deploy To SharePoint VSTS Build Step #

When developing SharePoint add-ins you typically need to deploy the add-in to a SharePoint online tenant upon successful build.
This Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Custom build step enables just that.

Simply configure the build step with details about the SharePoint tenant and the location of the .app-file in your build result 
and your add-in will be deployed automatically
